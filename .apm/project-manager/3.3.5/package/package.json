It currently only supports certain fields.\n\n### Edit Projects\nAll projects are saved in a `.cson` file which you can easily reach by searching for `Project Manager: Edit Projects` in the Command Palette.\n\n## Project Settings\n\nsetting    | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                           | Default               \n-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------\n`title`    | `string`  | Projects title. Used in the projects list                                                                                                | `''`                  \n`paths`    | `array`   | The folders that will open in the tree view. First path is the main one that counts as the project.                                                   | `[]`                  \n`settings` | `Object`  | Enables you to set project specific settings. Everything that goes in the `config.cson` file can go here. It also supports scoped settings.           | `{}`                  \n`icon`     | `string`  | Icon that shows in the projects list. It's class-based so can either be a class already provided by Atom like `icon-squirrel` or a class of your own. You can find a list of all icons on [octicons.github.com](https://octicons.github.com/). | `'icon-chevron-right'`\n`devMode`  | `boolean` | `true` if project should open in dev mode. [Look here][devMode] for more info.                                                                        | `false`               \n`group`    | `string`  | Adds a group to the projects list that can be used to group and filter projects                                                                       | `null`                \n`template` | `string`  | If you add a project in the `projects.cson` file without `paths` it will count as a template. This way you can easily share settings between projects | `null`                \n\n### Local settings file\nAll these settings can be added to a `project.cson` file in the root folder of the project. It follows the below example, but without the array.\n\n### Example\n```coffeescript\n[\n  {\n    title: 'Project Manager'\n    group: 'Atom'\n    paths: [\n      '/path/to/project-manager'\n    ]\n    devMode: true\n    settings:\n      'editor.tabLength': 4\n      'editor.showInvisibles': true\n  }\n]\n\n```\n\n## Provider\nIf you want to use the projects available through the Project Manager you can use the provided methods.\n\n```javascript\nfunction consumeProjectManager({ getProjects, getProject, saveProject, openProject } => {\n  /**\n   * Get an array containing all projects.\n   * The callback will be run each time a project is added.\n   */\n  getProjects(projects => {\n    // Do something with the projects.\n  });\n\n  /**\n   * Get the currently active project.\n   * The callback will be run whenever the active project changes.\n   */\n  getProject(project => {\n    if (project) {\n      // We have an active project.\n    } else {\n      // Project is either not loaded yet, or there is no project saved.\n    }\n  });\n\n  /**\n   * Can take either a project recieved from getProjects/getProject or\n   * just an object with the props for a new project.\n   */\n  saveProject(project);\n\n  /**\n   * Will open the project.\n   * `openInSameWindow` should be true if the project should open up in the\n   * current window.\n   */\n  openProject(project, openInSameWindow);\n});\n\n```\n\n\n## Contribute\nIf you would like to contribute to the project manager, be it new features or bugs,\nplease do the following:\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a new topic branch off the master branch that describe what it does\n3. Commit and push the branch\n4. Make a pull request describing what you have done\n5. Now it will hopefully get merged :)\n\nAll PR's should:\n- Pass the [eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) linter\n- Add a test when it makes sense, which should be most of the time\n\n[devMode]: https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.11.2/AtomEnvironment#instance-open\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager#readme","_id":"project-manager@3.3.5","_shasum":"145fbdfcb6c24d31e073e974c839bae9f2b44ff9","_resolved":"file:../d-1171015-4433-xg6swj.58d8xxyldi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1171015-4433-xg6swj.58d8xxyldi/package.tgz"}
