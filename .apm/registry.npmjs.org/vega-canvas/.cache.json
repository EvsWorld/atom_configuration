Projects that use this module and require canvas support for server-side (node.js) operations must include the desired dependencies in their own `package.json` file. Projects that use this module should also ensure that bundlers such as Webpack and Browserify appropriately exclude canvas dependencies by including `{\"canvas\": null, \"canvas-prebuilt\": null}` under the `\"browser\"` property in their `package.json` file.\n\n_Note:_ As a result of the design decision to exclude direct dependencies on canvas libraries, linking to this module locally via `npm link` can result in `require(...)` errors due to node's module resolution algorithm. To ensure successful resolution of canvas libraries, this module should be included as a direct subfolder (not a symlink).\n\n## API Reference\n\n<a name=\"canvas\" href=\"#canvas\">#</a>\nvega.<b>canvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/index.js \"Source\")\n\nCreates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method first attempts to create a canvas using the DOM `document.createElement` method. If that fails, the method then attempts to instantiate a canvas using the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library. Failing that, the method tries the [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) library. If all attempts fail, returns `null`.\n\n<a name=\"domCanvas\" href=\"#domCanvas\">#</a>\nvega.<b>domCanvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/src/domCanvas.js \"Source\")\n\nCreates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method first attempts to create a canvas using the DOM `document.createElement` method. If that fails, returns `null`.\n\n<a name=\"nodeCanvas\" href=\"#nodeCanvas\">#</a>\nvega.<b>nodeCanvas</b>([<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>])\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/src/nodeCanvas.js \"Source\")\n\nCreates a new [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) instance, with an optional *width* and *height* (in pixels). If *width* and *height* are omitted, creates a _0 x 0_ canvas. This method attempts to instantiate a canvas using using the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library. If that fails, it attempts to use the [node-canvas-prebuilt](https://github.com/node-gfx/node-canvas-prebuilt) library. If all attempts fail, returns `null`.\n\n<a name=\"image\" href=\"#image\">#</a>\nvega.<b>image</b>()\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/blob/master/index.js \"Source\")\n\nReturns a reference to the [Image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/Image) constructor. In a web browser environment, simply returns the built-in `Image` object. Otherwise, attempts to return the `Image` instance exported by a node canvas library. If all attempts to find a canvas library fail, returns `null`.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jheer","email":"jeffrey.heer@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-30T18:17:17.906Z","created":"2018-01-24T23:32:48.889Z","1.0.0":"2018-01-24T23:32:48.889Z","1.0.1":"2018-01-30T18:17:17.906Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas#readme","keywords":["vega","canvas","image"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas.git"},"author":{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","url":"http://idl.cs.washington.edu"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vega/vega-canvas/issues"},"license":"BSD-3-Clause","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a70b6ad-21c5\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 18:17:17 GMT"}
