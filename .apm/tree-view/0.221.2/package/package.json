These icons are customizable by\ninstalling a package that provides an `atom.file-icons` service.\n\nThe `atom.file-icons` service must provide the following methods:\n* `iconClassForPath(path)` - Returns a CSS class name to add to the file view.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view#readme","_id":"tree-view@0.221.2","_shasum":"e1c07b8bb2fd38199764a0a761e4cd3d10a09131","_resolved":"file:../d-1171010-7935-htcl6i.0icceuerk9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1171010-7935-htcl6i.0icceuerk9/package.tgz"}
